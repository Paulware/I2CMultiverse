I2C Multiverse

<ul>
<li>Purpose<br>
  The purpose of the I2C Multiverse is to create lego-like components that 
can easily be added or removed from a project.  Each component will communicate
with the master using I2C (pronounced I-Squared-C).  
</li>
<li>  
Form<br>
  Each component will be follow the form of an Arduino shield, but the 
only pins that are passed to each shield are 5V, GND, SDA (A4) and SCL (A5).
Within each component are 2 atmega328s:
  <ul>
  <li>communicate with the rest of the system using I2C</li>
  <li>communicate with the component which can also be a shield</li>
  </ul>
</li>

  <li>Ultrasonic distance measuring device using US-020 (7 meter range)</li>
  <li>HBridge control to drive 2 L298s</li>
